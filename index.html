  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The Extension does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data.</p>

  <h2>How the Extension Works</h2>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The Extension requests only the minimal permissions required to perform its core function, including access to the current tab and downloads API to save images locally.</p>
